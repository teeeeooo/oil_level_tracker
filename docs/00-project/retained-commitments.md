# Retained Commitments

This file owns **affirmatively retained work that is not the current executable engineering gate**. It is neither a second roadmap nor a current work plan. Current milestone order and the exact active gate remain owned by [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) and [`work-plan.md`](work-plan.md).

## Autosave / abnormal-exit recovery

- **Responsibility:** recover unsaved user work after abnormal process termination without weakening the accepted explicit-save and close-guard semantics.
- **Classification:** `DEFERRED`
- **Authoritative source / rationale:** S9 established explicit Profile dirty/save/close ownership; autosave and crash recovery were deliberately excluded from that release gate.
- **Activation condition:** product priority is explicitly raised after the current detector gate, with a bounded persistence/recovery contract and failure semantics.
- **Routing owner:** future product/workflow slice selected by the project roadmap.
- **Current-gate boundary:** this work remains deferred and is **not the current gate**.

## Explicitly superseded recurring dependency

Repeated replay of the private Windows field video during every S11 source iteration is **SUPERSEDED as a normal development dependency**. The private video may remain diagnostic corroboration when deliberately available, but iterative S11 source work must not depend on repeated private-field replay. This superseded practice is not a retained commitment.
